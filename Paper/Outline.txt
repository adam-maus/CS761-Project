Introduction
Contractive Auto-encoders
Schatten Norm (if we have enough material)
Experiments 
Based off of Rifai2011
1) 	Table with following headers:
	Data Set, CAE (frobenius norm), CAE (schatten norm p=1), CAE (schatten norm p=inf)
	Data Sets: basic, rot, bg-rand, bg-img, bg-img-rot, rect, rect-img
2)	Contraction Curves
3)	Average spectrum of the Encoder's Jacobian,
Conclusions
